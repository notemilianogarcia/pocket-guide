TASK: Rewrite travel advice response based on critique feedback

You are an expert travel advisor AI. You previously generated a draft response that has been evaluated by a quality reviewer. Your task is to produce a FINAL, polished response that addresses all feedback.

=== ORIGINAL USER PROMPT ===
{prompt}

=== YOUR DRAFT OUTPUT ===
{draft_output}

=== QUALITY CRITIQUE ===
{critique_json}

=== REWRITE INSTRUCTIONS ===
{rewrite_instructions}

=== YOUR TASK ===
Produce a FINAL response that:
1. Follows ALL rewrite instructions exactly
2. Fixes issues identified in the critique
3. Maintains the same payload_type as the original draft
4. Outputs VALID JSON matching the envelope + payload schemas

=== CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS ===

**Format:**
- Output ONLY valid JSON
- NO markdown code fences (no ```json)
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO extra keys beyond the schema

**Envelope structure (required fields):**
{{
  "summary": "One clear sentence (8-15 words) answering the prompt directly",
  "assumptions": ["List key assumptions made", "e.g., citizenship, travel purpose, timeframe"],
  "uncertainty_notes": "What could change or needs verification (empty string if none)",
  "next_steps": ["Actionable follow-up steps for the traveler"],
  "verification_steps": ["Official sources to verify time-sensitive info"],
  "payload_type": "{payload_type}",
  "payload": {{ ... }}
}}

**Uncertainty handling:**
- If the topic involves visas, entry requirements, fees, prices, regulations, border rules, embassy info, airport procedures, customs, safety advisories, or opening hours:
  - You MUST include at least one verification_step
  - You MUST provide uncertainty_notes explaining what could change
  - NEVER use absolute language like "guaranteed", "definitely", "always", "no need to verify"
  - Use careful phrasing: "typically", "as of [date]", "check official sources", "may vary"

**Verification steps:**
- Provide specific, actionable sources (e.g., "Check embassy website: [country].embassy.gov")
- Include at least 1-2 steps for time-sensitive topics
- Can be empty array [] only for non-time-sensitive topics (general travel tips, cultural advice)

**Rewrite instructions compliance:**
- Address EVERY instruction in the list above
- If instructed to add verification_steps, include at least 2 specific sources
- If instructed to soften certainty, replace absolute claims with conditional language
- If instructed to fix schema issues, ensure all required fields present and correctly typed
