You are an expert travel assistant quality reviewer. Your task is to critique a generated travel response for training data quality.

ORIGINAL PROMPT:
{prompt}

GENERATED RESPONSE:
{output_text}

CONTRACT VALIDATION RESULTS:
{contract_json}

---

CRITIQUE INSTRUCTIONS:
Evaluate the response for:
1. **Hallucination Risk**: Does it include specific claims (dates, prices, names, schedules) that can't be verified and may become outdated or false? Time-sensitive information increases risk.
2. **Overconfidence**: Does it state uncertain information as fact without appropriate hedging?
3. **Schema Compliance**: Does it match the required JSON structure (envelope + payload)? Check against contract validation results.
4. **Actionability**: Are recommendations specific and implementable, or vague and generic?
5. **Clarity**: Is the language clear and well-organized?
6. **Verification Steps**: For time-sensitive or critical information (schedules, prices, availability), does it include guidance to verify before acting?
7. **Safety**: Does it include appropriate warnings or caveats where needed?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object matching this structure (no prose, no markdown):

```json
{{
  "id": "{draft_id}",
  "verdict": "pass|revise|reject",
  "issues": [
    {{
      "type": "hallucination|overconfidence|schema|verification|actionability|clarity|safety",
      "severity": "low|medium|high",
      "message": "Description of the issue",
      "evidence_path": "payload.section.field (optional)"
    }}
  ],
  "scores": {{
    "actionability": 1-5,
    "clarity": 1-5,
    "schema_compliance": 1-5,
    "safety_risk": 1-5
  }},
  "hallucination": {{
    "risk_level": "low|medium|high",
    "risky_claims": ["claim1", "claim2"],
    "rationale": "Explanation of risk assessment"
  }},
  "verification": {{
    "missing_when_needed": true|false,
    "suggested_steps": ["step1", "step2"]
  }},
  "schema": {{
    "envelope_ok": true|false,
    "payload_ok": true|false,
    "notes": "Schema compliance observations",
    "missing_fields": ["field1", "field2"]
  }},
  "rewrite_instructions": [
    "Imperative instruction 1",
    "Imperative instruction 2"
  ]
}}
```

VERDICT GUIDELINES:
- **pass**: Response is high quality, actionable, safe, and schema-compliant. Minor issues acceptable if low severity.
- **revise**: Response has medium/high severity issues but is salvageable with targeted improvements.
- **reject**: Response has critical flaws (major hallucinations, safety issues, completely wrong schema) that make refinement impractical.

IMPORTANT:
- Output ONLY the JSON object, no additional text
- Be strict but fair: nitpicking minor style issues is not helpful
- Focus on training data quality: will this example teach good or bad patterns?
- Use rewrite_instructions to be specific about improvements (imperative mood: "Remove specific date", "Add verification step")
